### Hi there 👋

My name is Phan Quang Lam, you can call me Lam.
I'm a web developer/bridge system engineer/project manager. I'm from Vietnam and currently living in a small peaceful island in the south of Japan.
I started my career from 2015, and have mainly worked with Ruby on Rails projects.
Recently (2021) I'm working with a local client on a new SaaS product in construction industry, built with Rails and VueJS.

I have some devops experience with AWS EC2, CloudFormation, ECS (which means I'm familiar with Docker too). Actually I'm studying to get the AWS Solution Architect Associate certificate in this November.

⚡ Currenly I'm open to opportunities to work in English-speaking environments. It'd be best if there is a chance to go living in US/Canada for some years. I'm just curious and excited to have some living & working experience there.

😄 Fun fact:
* Cat lover with 4 cats :cat2:
  * Chibe: named by the previous owner. He came to our house 1-2 months after we moved to the island
  * Maron: I saw him at a vegetable field next to the road back home, in a heavy rain night, so I brought him home. His name means chestnut.
  * Mikan: He came to our garden some days then my wife decided to bring him in. His name means citrus.
  * Mit: My friend found her near a beach with one of her eye in bad condition. My friend cannot keep her so we took her home. Her name means jackfruit in Vietnamese.
* My bachelor degree is about Business Administrator, majored in Accounting and Finance, but I have only work in that industry for 2 weeks before deciding to become a web developer.

:cocktail: Hobbies:
* reading :books: (blogs about Ruby and Rails, books about clean code, estimatation, remote working, etc.)
* coding :page_with_curl: (finally got some spare time to do open source)
* growing vegetables :seedling:
