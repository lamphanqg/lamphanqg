### Hi there 👋

My name is Lam.
I'm a Backend Engineer. I'm from Vietnam and currently living in a small city in Japan.
I started my career from 2015, and have mainly worked with Ruby on Rails projects.

😄 Fun fact:
* Cat lover with 2 cats :cat2:
* My bachelor degree is about Business Administrator, majored in Accounting and Finance, but I have only work in that industry for 2 weeks before decided to become a web developer.

:cocktail: Hobbies:
* reading :books: (blogs about Ruby and Rails, books about clean code, estimatation, remote working, etc.)
* coding :page_with_curl: (finally got some spare time to do open source)
* drinking 🍶 I especially love drinks from rice, e.g. 日本酒
* hiking ⛰️ I started hiking from 2022 after I joined YAMAP, and now my wife and I go hiking every month.
