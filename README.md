### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lam.
I'm a web developer/bridge system engineer/project manager. I'm from Vietnam and currently living in a small peaceful island in the south of Japan.
I started my career from 2015, and have mainly worked with Ruby on Rails projects.
Recently (2021) I'm working with a local client on a new SaaS product in construction industry, built with Rails and VueJS.

I have some devops experience with AWS EC2, CloudFormation, ECS (which means I'm familiar with Docker too). Actually I'm studying to get the AWS Solution Architect Associate certificate in this November.

âš¡ Currenly I'm open to opportunities to work in English-speaking environments. It'd be best if there is a chance to go living in US/Canada for some years. I'm just curious and excited to have some living & working experience there.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact:
* Cat lover with 4 cats :cat2:
* My bachelor degree is about Business Administrator, majored in Accounting and Finance, but I have only work in that industry for 2 weeks before decided to become a web developer.

:cocktail: Hobbies:
* reading :books: (blogs about Ruby and Rails, books about clean code, estimatation, remote working, etc.)
* coding :page_with_curl: (finally got some spare time to do open source)
* growing vegetables :seedling:
